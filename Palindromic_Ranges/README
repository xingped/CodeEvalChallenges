"Palindromic Ranges" CodeEval Challenge
Initially presented by: deviantART
Solved by: Paul Gatterdam


Challenge Description
---------------
A positive integer is a palindrome if its decimal representation (without
leading zeros) is a palindromic string (a string that reads the same forwards
and backwards). For example, the numbers 5, 77, 363, 4884, 11111, 12121 and
349943 are palindromes.

A range of integers is interesting if it contains an even number of
palindromes. The range [L, R], with L <= R, is defined as the sequence of
integers from L to R (inclusive): (L, L+1, L+2, ..., R-1, R). L and R are the 
range's first and last numbers.

The range [L1,R1] is a subrange of [L,R] if L <= L1 <= R1 <= R. Your job is to
determine how many interesting subranges of [L,R] there are.


Input
---------------
Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each
line in this file is one test case. Each test case will contain two positive
integers, L and R (in that order), separated by a space. eg.

1 2
1 7
87 88


Output
---------------
For each line of input, print out the number of interesting subranges of
[L,R] eg.

1
12
1

For the curious: In the third example, the subranges are: [87](0 palindromes),
[87,88](1 palindrome),[88](1 palindrome). Hence the number of interesting
palindromic ranges is 1.
